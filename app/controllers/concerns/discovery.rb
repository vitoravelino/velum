  # TODO(mssola):
  #  1. It would make more sense to have the update status on the DB and have
  #     another process polling for this. Then, on the `discovery` method this
  #     would all be returned transparently (thus removing all the methods below).
  #  2. NOTE: Other nodes should only be taken into consideration if
  #     automatic updates has not been enabled.
